      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Three Amish fathers, including the father of one Frieda Yoder, withdrew their children at ages 14 and 15 from school in Wisconsin to have them pursue an alternative education provided by the Amish instead, in accordance with their Amish way of life.</p>
      <ul><li>The Amish believe that higher formal education after 16, whether through its content or competitiveness, will endanger the childrens' faith and continuation of the Amish faith itself. Hence, the Amish usually withdraw their children from school before the age of 16 and instead provide alternative education for them, which prepares them for adult roles in their community as well as train them to be law-abiding and self-sufficient pious citizens.</li></ul><p>
      This violated a Wisconsin state law that made school attendance compulsory until the students were at least 16 years of age, and consequently, the fathers were fined $5 each, but they refused to pay and sued the state in court under grounds that the Wisconsin law violated the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment.
      While a trial and circuit court upheld the convictions, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that the application of the law to the Amish religion was unconstitutional and violated the Constitution’s Free Exercise clause. As such, the State of Wisconsin took the case to the Supreme Court.

    <div> <!--major question-->
      <h2>Major Question</h2>
      <p>“Did Wisconsin's requirement that all parents send their children to school at least until age 16 violate the First Amendment by criminalizing the conduct of parents who refused to send their children to school for religious reasons?”</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--clauses and precedents-->
      <h2>Relevant Constitutional Clauses and Supreme Court Precedents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Free Exercise Clause(First Amendment): “<em>Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise</em> [of religion]...”</li>
        <li>Due Process Clause(Fourteenth Amendment): “...<em>nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law</em>...”</li>
        <li><em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em> - The Yoder case took a lot of precedence from the Pierce case due to their similarities. In the Pierce case, there was a state law in Oregon that mandated compulsory attendance to public schools up to the age of 16. An order of nuns that cared for orphans and provided Catholic education sued against this law on grounds that it violated the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment, just like the Yoder case. The Supreme Court, similarly to the Yoder case, ruled in favor of the sisters in the Pierce case in that compulsory public school attendance is unconstitutional for families who would rather send their children to private schools for religious reasons due to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</li>

      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Majority opinion written by Warren Burger</dt>
        <dd>The majority opinion stated that the free exercise of the Amish religion outweighed the state’s interests in compulsory school attendance before 8th grade. Since the Amish religion was an established religion with a long history, its traditions and culture are enough to override the state’s mandatory school attendance laws due to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
        </dd>
        <dt>Dissenting-in-part opinion written by William Douglas</dt>
        <dd>Justice Douglas asserted that in this case, the religious interest of the children was not considered. Rather, it was the parents's religious beliefs that were considered in the case. In the case of Frieda Yoder, her testimony in the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed her Amish religious faith, and therefore the Free Exercise Clause should apply to her. However, the religious interests of the other two children were unknown, and therefore the ruling was void and the Free Exercise Clause shouldn't apply for those two children until their religious faith was affirmed.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Potter Stewart</dt>
        <dd>In repoinse to Justice Douglas, Justice Stewart believes that the childrens' religious interests or choice in schooling is the issue of the case. In fact, no records show that the religious beliefs of the children conflicted with their parents or stated otherwise.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Byron White</dt>
        <dd>It would be a different case altogether if the children stopped going to school altogether because of their parents, or if their future education conflicted with the state's educational standards. However, since they are receiving alternative education that teaches them to become law-abiding and self-sufficient citizens, their withdrawal from school is permitted. Missing a year or two of public school in exchange for a good alternative education in correspondance to their religion isn't so problematic as to violate their free exercise rights by prioritizing the state's interest over their religion.</dd>

    <div> <!--relevance-->
      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p><em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em> bolstered the incorporation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment in the states by saying that if laws that conflict with the way of life of historically-established religions, then those laws conflict with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
      This includes if the government’s interest in compulsory education conflicted with a religion whose children usually left school to pursue some other aspect of life, as seen in Wisconsin’s law conflicting with the Amish way of life.
      <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em> not only was used to defend the right to withdraw children from public schooling, but also the right for parents to homeschool their children, taking Justice White's opinion as legal precedence.
      The case also established that in order for a religion to be considered as a protected religion under the First Amendment, it must be a well-established religion with a respected history, and cannot be something that someone made up on a whim in order to justify violating a law. The Amish religion falls under the "well-established religion" category, as it has historically been a self-sufficient and viable way of life with a respectable religious history and traditions.
      Today, the Yoder case remains one of the top cases dealing with freedom of religion by state and federal law, placing the traditions of religions over the interests of state and federal governments.
