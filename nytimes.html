      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered the creation of the “Pentagon Papers”, which were a series of studies that documented the US’s involvement in the Vietnam War in a perspective contrary to public belief.</p>
      <ul><li>The Pentagon Papers portrayed the Vietnam War in a negative light, documenting the increased American casualties of the war as well as the weapons and methods used to attack the Viet Cong, such as mustard gas and firebombing.</li></ul>
      <p>Eventually, a man named Daniel Ellisberg got hold of a copy of these documents, copied them, and sent the copy to various news outlets, such as the Washington Post and the New York Times.
      After the Washington Post and the New York Times posted their first articles on the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration invoked prior restraint and ordered an injunction for the newspapers to stop posting the articles in order to prevent future information from being leaked, citing the Espionage Act as a basis for the censorship.</p>
      <ul><li><strong>Prior restraint</strong> is the process to which the government attempts to prevent the publication of a news article or presentation due to its contents.</li></ul>
      <p>While the injunction for the New York Times was eventually approved, the one for the Washington Post was not, leading to an appeal to the Supreme Court.

      <h2>Major Question</h2>
      <p>"Did the Nixon administration's efforts to prevent the publication of what it termed 'classified information' violate the First Amendment?”</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--clauses and precedents-->
      <h2>Relevant Constitutional Clauses and Supreme Court Precedents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Freedom of Speech and Press(1st Amendment) - “<em>Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press</em>...”</li>
        <li><em>Near v. Minnesota</em> - <em>Near v. Minnesota</em> established that the use of prior restraint is disfavorable by the Supreme Court. This is seen in <em>New York Times v. United States</em> in that the Court struck down the use of it by the Nixon administration even when classified information was leaked to the public.</li>
        <li><em>Dennis v. United States</em> - The Supreme Court in <em>Dennis v. United States</em> determined that speech that poses a vital threat to the United States is not protected under the First Amendment. This idea was also used in <em>New York Times v. United States</em> in determining whether prior restraint was justified by the Nixon administration, as the Court based its ruling off of if the Pentagon Papers posted by the press presented a vital threat to the United State’s armed forces.</li>

      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>Per curiam</em> opinion (collective opinion written by the entire Court)</dt>
        <dd>The Nixon Administration failed to clearly provide sufficient evidence that the Pentagon Papers presented a clear and imminent threat to the United States or her armed forces, and therefore the federal government should not be granted the injunctions for the two news outlets.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Hugo Black</dt>
        <dd>Prior restraint and other types of governmental censorship are practically unconstitutional in the framers’ point of view. This is especially true in regards to governmental criticism, which should virtually always be protected under the First Amendment. Furthermore, citing national security interests is not enough justification to start censoring the words of the public.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by William Douglas</dt>
        <dd>The First Amendment prohibits almost all types of governmental censorship on speech, no matter the justification.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by William Brennan Jr.</dt>
        <dd>The Pentagon Papers did not fall under the categories of speech that weren’t protected by the First Amendment: military secrets(the information in the papers did not jeopardize any current military operation and was several years old), obscenities, or fighting words.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Potter Stewart</dt>
        <dd>Though national security can be considered in this case, national transparency and the spread of information is critical for keeping the public informed and the democracy stable, especially when it comes to foreign affairs, which the executive branch holds the most power over.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Thurgood Marshall</dt>
        <dd>The courts’ authority to challenge the issuing of prior restraint is questionable due to separation of powers. Nevertheless, the executive branch in this case was overly vague when describing how the prior restraint that was attempted here was connected to national security.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Byron White</dt>
        <dd>If there is an absence of intervention or guidance by Congress, the Supreme Court should not give the executive branch such broad power over the people, especially in this case of censorship of the press.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3 class="ruling">Dissenting</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by Warren Burger</dt>
        <dd>There should be greater responsibility on the newspapers to investigate if the Pentagon Papers were a threat to national security, as there isn’t enough time to properly review the case in Burger’s eyes. It is important to note that Justice Burger didn’t find that the prior restraint was justified, only that more investigation was required and that the decision was hastily made.</dd>
        <dt>Dissenting opinions individually written by John Harlan II and Harry Blackmun</dt>
        <dd>The Supreme Court should defer more to the executive branch during times of war such as back then, during the Vietnam War. Furthermore, in agreement with Justice Burger, Justice Harlan believes that the decision was hastily made.</dd>

      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p>The case established restrictions on the usage of prior restraint by the federal government, marking it as a form of censorship of the press by the government.
      Now, prior restraint can now only be used if the information that is published by the press presents a clear and imminent danger to the nation’s citizens or armed forces.
      The case also established that it is up to the government to provide a sufficiently heavy amount of necessary evidence that a news outlet’s information presents a clear and imminent threat in order to legally justify a usage of prior restraint on that article.
      The NY Times case was a win for freedom of the press, as the ruling ensured the government cannot censor any information published by the press without hard and sufficient evidence that it endangered the lives of United States citizens.
      This is especially true in the case of classified information that wouldn’t hurt the armed forces during wartime, such as the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. Overall, without this case or if this case ruled differently, there wouldn't be as much information published by the press as there would be today about the corruption and activities done by the government that they would rather the public not see.
      <br><br>
      As for the impact of the case itself, the voided injuctions allowed the New York Times and the Washington Post to freely publish the contents of the Pentagon Papers without worry of government intervention. This led to anti-war sentiments drastically increasing the United States against the Vietnam War as American citizens learned about the atrocities committted by the United States military in Vietnam, as well as the the increased casualties the Viet Cong inflicted on American troops. This contrasted with what the government said on press channels about the war effort in Vietnam, which caused an outrage throughout America as anti-war sentiments increased, leading to large protests of all kinds, which eventually led to a full withdrawal from the Vietnam War by America.
