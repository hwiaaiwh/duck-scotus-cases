      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>During the first World War, the federal government used the draft to conscript many Americans into the military to fight in Europe.
      However, there were many anti-war sentiments from many groups in America, including the Socialist Party of America. In opposition to the draft imposed by the United States, the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia authorized the General Secretary of the party, Charles Schenck, to print and distribute 15,000 anti-draft leaflets to the public.
      In collaboration with socialist Elizabeth Baer, Schenck distributed these leaflets that declared the draft was unconstitutional under the Thirteenth Amendment and therefore should not be obeyed, arguing that the draft was a form of "involuntary servitude" and urging the populace to "assert their rights".
      This violated the Espionage Act of 1917, though, and Schenck and Baer were arrested and convicted for  attempting to cause insubordination and for obstructing the conscription draft for the military.</p>
      <ul><li>Congress passed the Espionage Act in 1917, which was drafted to prevent insubordination in the military and interference to the operation of the United States armed forces, as well as sedition and the aiding of enemies by US soldiers and civilians.</li></ul>
      <p>They attempted to appeal the conviction under grounds that the Espionage Act violated the First Amendment’s right to freedom of speech, and the Supreme Court would hear the case soon after.

      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Majority opinion written by Oliver Holmes Jr.</dt>
        <dd>The majority opinion held that the Espionage Act didn’t violate the First Amendment due to Congress’s wartime authority. They concluded that the First Amendment does not protect speech that presents a “clear and present” threat to the United States that Congress has the power to prevent. The majority also felt that during wartime, the courts owed a greater deference to the other branches more involved with war, including Congress, the leading authority during times of war. Justice Holmes compared the distribution of leaflets, meant to disrupt the conscription process, to yelling “Fire!” in a movie theater; both of which presented a “clear and present” threat and therefore is not protected under the First Amendment.

      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p>The <em>Schenck v. United States</em> case established the “clear and present danger” test, which the Court uses to determine whether speech was not protected by the First Amendment because it threatens the livelihood of the citizens of the United States.
      In <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio</em> however, the Court moved away from the broader “clear and present danger” test to a more lenient and specific policy that is more protective of free speech rights.
      <em>Schenck v. United States</em> would be overturned by <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio</em>, as well as other subsequent cases, as the Court moved away from the “clear and present danger” test and enforced freedom of speech more often.
      Overall, the Schenck case’s “clear and present danger” precedent placed restrictions on not only freedom of speech, but also for the press and assembly. The “clear and present danger” test became a way for the government to censor speech, the press, and assemblies under the grounds that they presented a "clear and present danger" to the American people.
      Even after the broad test itself, the general idea of the test still applies to this day, namely the fact that freedom of speech, the press, and assembly can still be revoked if they demonstrated a threat to the people in America. <em>New York Times v. United States</em> was an example of this policy attempting to censor the press, though in the end the idea of "clear and present danger" did not apply to the New York Times in that case.
