      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>In protest of the ongoing Vietnam War, 5 students(4 from the Tinker family and 1 friend) in Des Moines, Iowa decided to wear black armbands to school to advocate for and support a Christmas truce in Vietnam.
      Two of the children(Christopher Echhardt and John Tinker) were in high school, one(Mary Beth Tinker) in junior high, and the other two(Hope and Paul Tinker) were in elementary school.
      Their plan was to wear black armbands during the holiday season and to fast on December 16 and New Year’s Eve.
      However, the principals of these schools caught wind of the plan, and preemptively implemented a policy banning armbands, with violation resulting in suspension.
      On December 16, two children, Christopher Eckhardt and Mary Beth Tinker wore armbands to school and were promptly sent home. The next day, the other high school student, John Tinker, did the same and was also sent home. Only the elementary school students, Hope and Paul Tinker, received no penalty.
      In conjunction with the ACLU and Iowa’s Civil Liberties Union, the parents of the Tinkers filed a lawsuit against the school board that implemented these changes and challenged the policy in court under grounds that it violated the students' First Amendment’s rights to protest and speech.

      <h2>Major Question</h2>
      <p>“Does a prohibition against the wearing of armbands in public school, as a form of symbolic protest, violate the students' freedom of speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment?”</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--clauses and precedents-->
      <h2>Relevant Constitutional Clauses and Supreme Court Precedents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Freedom of Speech, Assembly, and Petition(First Amendment): “<em>Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech...or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances</em>”</li>
        <li>Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause(Fourteenth Amendment): "<em>“No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law</em>..."</li>
        <li><em>Burnside v. Byars</em> (United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit) - <em>Burnside v. Byars</em> was a US Court of Appeals case that dealt with censorship of speech in public schools by school officials, this time in Philadelphia, Mississippi. The case set the precedent that in order for school officials to censor an expression of speech by students, the officials must substantially prove that the expression will disrupt the operation and discipline of the school and interfere with the education of the school’s students. This is known as the “substantial disruption test", and would later set the precedent for the ruling of <em>Tinker v. Des Moines</em> and the establishment of the "Tinker test."

      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Majority opinion written by Abe Fortas</dt>
        <dd>The majority opinion asserted that the First Amendment protected the freedom of speech for students in public schools, meaning that any policy restricting any form of speech must be justified on constitutional grounds. In order to justify the suppression of speech on school grounds, the school board must be able to provide conclusive evidence that the speech would disrupt the operation of the school and/or the discipline of the school's students. In this case, the armbands were an example of speculative fear from the school board and did not cause actual disruption to the school, which is not conclusive enough to justify the suppression of it from school grounds, esepcially since it is a form of protest and speech.
        </dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Potter Stewart</dt>
        <dd>While in concurrence with the majority, Justice Stewart believed that children do not necessarily enjoy the full protections of the First Amendment due to their age and limited capacity for individual freedom of choice.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Byron White</dt>
        <dd>Justice White notes should be noted that the majority opinion, and the Court in general, relies on a distinction between speech by words and speech by actions.</dt>
      </dl>
      <h3 class="ruling">Dissenting</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by Hugo Black</dt>
        <dd>The First Amendment does not grant the ability to express an opinion at any time. Furthermore, the black armbands distracted students from working by the nature to which it draws attention to the student, which detracted from the ability for school officials and teachers to perform their duties. Therefore, the school board was justified in banning the black armbands.</dd>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by John Harlan II</dt>
        <dd>School officials should be given a wide range of authority in the operation and maintenance of their schools to maintain order and perform their duties, unless their actions stemmed from personal motivation rather than the interests of the schools.</dd>

      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p><em>Tinker v. Des Moines</em> established that free speech is a right protected on public school grounds, so long as it doesn’t violate the already-established First Amendment restrictions from other cases such as the Schenck case(clear and present danger).
      This means that students can more freely exercise their free speech in public schools without much restriction, such as through wearing armbands as a call to awareness or staging walkouts as a form of protest. In essence, <em>Tinker v. Des Moines</em> incorporated the right to free speech and, in theory, protest into government-funded public schools and, in proxy, the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.<br><br>
      This case also established the “Tinker test”, which is a tool that the Supreme Court uses to determine if the censorship of free speech on school grounds was justifiable because it disrupted the operation and/or discipline of the schoo. The Tinker test was used to rule in other cases of free speech and the censorship thereof on school grounds, such as allowing students to wear cancer awareness bands or prohibiting students from displaying the Confederate flag.
      While the Tinker case expanded free speech rights for students in schools, there are a few other Supreme Court cases that have limited the impact of the Tinker case, such as <em>Bethel School District v. Fraser</em>, <em>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</em>, and <em>Morse v. Frederick</em>. These cases have given school officials more discretion in limiting and punishing students’ speech, such as in cases of vulgar language, student newspaper articles, and the promotion of illegal drug usage, respectively.
