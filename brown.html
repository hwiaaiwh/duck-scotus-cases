      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p><em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, in the Supreme Court, is a consolidation of multiiple cases that happened across different states such as Kansas, Viriginia, and North Carolina.
      All of these cases have one thing in common: they all argued on the segregation of public schools by race under the "separate but equal" doctrine. Specifcally, if the segregation was constitutional or not under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
      Segregation of white and colored people into different schools was a common practice back in the early 1900's. However, schools that contained black and colored students were usually given less funding and weren't as maintained as their white counterparts.
      As such, African-American students have tried to get into these "white-only" public schools, though due to the Jim Crow laws, they were not allowed to access and use those facilities due to the color of their skin.
      Because of this, these students and their families, usually from different state, sued their respective local board of education, leading to the cases reaching the Supreme Court.

      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p>The ruling of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> practically allowed schools to be desegregated, allowing children to have an equal access to education regardless of their race.
        However, the ruling of the Brown case was too vague to be implemented properly, and some states that used segregated schools refused to follow the order. This led to <em>Brown v. Board of Education II</em>, to which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled on a set of procedures that should be followed in the desegregation of public schools, overseen by other federal trial courts, in a mannwer "with all deliberate speed". Still, there were some states that had refused to integrate schools, including the infamous Little Rock Nine incident, in which the President at the time, Dwight D. Eisenhower, was forced to dispatch federal troops in order to protect nine African-American students from mobs and state troops deployed by the governor of Arkansas that tried to prevent the students from entering a desegregated high school in Little Rock, Arkansas.
        <br><br>
        The case also fueled a revolution of civil rights in the nation through movements and protests that would eventually lead to the desegregation of the entire country. This includes the Rosa Parks arrest, the Montgomery Bus boycotts, demonstrations and marches led by Martin Luther King Jr., and other protests that led to the dissolution of the Southern Jim Crow laws.
        Because the ruling overturned the “separate but equal” doctrine that was set by <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, it became the legal precedent for future laws and acts regarding civil rights, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
        Overall, if it were not for the ruling of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, society in America today would still be racially segregated in some way, shape, or form, as the case was the start of the process of desegregation in the United States and had led to other laws and acts that eventually dissolved the Jim Crow laws and dismantled segregation of all races in America.
        Today, <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> finds some relevance in the ongoing case of affirmative action in college admissions and higher education, as the preferential treatment to some people based on race for college admissions can be seen as unfavorable treatment to other people, which can be tied to the limiting of access to education based on racial segregation seen in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.</p>
