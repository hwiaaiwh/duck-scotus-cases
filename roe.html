      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Jane Roe, a fictional pseudonym made to protect the plaintiff’s identity, wanted an abortion for her pregnancy in Texas.
          However, Texas state laws made abortion illegal save for when a doctor orders it to save the woman’s life.
          Because of this, Roe sued the local district attorney, Henry Wade, to challenge the constitutionality of the law banning abortion, stating that the law was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated her constitutional right to privacy from the 1st, 4th, 5th, 9th, and 14th Amendments.
          A federal district court heard the case, and in a three-judge panel voted in favor of Roe in that the state law was unconstitutional. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court to hear it.</p>

    <div> <!--major question-->
      <h2>Major Question</h2>
      <p>“Does the Constitution recognize a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?”</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--clauses and precedents-->
      <h2>Relevant Constitutional Clauses and Supreme Court Precedents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Due Process Clause(Fourteenth Amendment): “[...] <em>nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law</em> [...]”</li>
        <li>Ninth Amendment: "<em>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people</em>."</li>
        <li><em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em> - Parallels from both cases can be drawn as they both dealt with the topic of contraception and life before birth. In <em>Griswold v. Connecticut</em>, the Supreme Court ruled that laws that banned contraceptives for married couples are unlawful as it violated the right to privacy, which was not in the Constitution but rather was implied from the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Amendments. Using the precedent from this case, the plaintiff and majority opinion in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> argued that abortions are legal on the basis that they’re a part of a woman’s right to privacy due to these amendments.</li>
        <li><em>United States v. Vuitch</em> - The Vuitch case dealt with a DC law that banned abortions unless the mother’s life was in danger. While the Roe case effectively overturned it, the Vuitch case established the general rule that abortions are allowed if the woman’s life was in danger because of the pregnancy, and that it is up to licensed medical practitioners to determine if an abortion was necessary, not a prosecutor or officer of the law.</li>

      <h2>Ruling and Opinions</h2>
      <h3>[7-2] in favor of Roe</h3>
      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Majority opinion written by Harry Blackmun</dt>
        <dd>The majority opinion believes that a woman’s right to abortion is protected by the right to privacy by the Ninth Amendment's overarching list of implied rights and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They also established a framework for the legality of abortions based on trimesters:
          <ul>
            <li>First trimester: states cannot restrict a woman’s right to abortion whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Second trimester: states cannot restrict or intervene a woman’s right to abortion unless if her health is at risk, as determined byy a licensed medical practicioner.</li>
            <li>Third trimester: state may restrict a woman’s right to abortion but must include an exception to any passed regulation if an abortion protects the health of the mother</li>
          </ul></dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinions written by William Douglas and Potter Stewart</dt>
        <dd>Both Justices Douglas and Stewart believe that the right to privacy is more rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Ninth Amendment. Specifically, Justice Stewart believes that the right to privacy is a fundamental right linked to "liberty" that is granted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Warren Burger</dt>
        <dd>While Justice Burger does concur with the ruling, he believes that it is up to <em>two</em> medical practicioners rather than one to determine the feasibility and legality of an abortion.</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3 class="ruling">Dissenting</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by Byron White</dt>
        <dd>Justice Bryon White’s dissenting opinion points out that the rigid framework for the legality of abortion has no Constitutional basis or any other legal foundation to prove it. Not only that, but he believes that giving the Supreme Court the right to create a foundation for any state laws is an overreach of the Court’s power and takes power away from state legislatures.</dd>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by William Rehnquist</dt>
        <dd>Justice William Rehnquist also made a dissenting opinion building off of White’s dissent, but also includes the fact that when the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, anti-abortion laws were already in place then. This meant that during the ratification of the 14th Amendment, anti-abortion laws were legal and valid, since the drafters at the time would’ve believed it to be valid under the 14th Amendment else they would’ve included it in the drafting of the amendment.

      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p>Until recently, <em>Roe v. Wade</em> abolished any state law that restricted women’s right to an abortion by providing a defined and static structure for any future laws that held jurisdiction over abortion.
      <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, alongside other cases such as <em>Loving v. Virginia</em>(ended restrictions on interracial marriages) and <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em>(ended restrictions on same-sex marriages), also set a precedent for many other cases that dealt with the right to privacy such as <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em>(upheld the Roe case) and <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em>(consensual, non-procreative sexual activity is constitutional).
      <br><br>However, the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em> in 2022 with the decision of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em> by returning the power to regulate abortions fully back to the states.
      Preceding this were many states’ trigger laws that would be put into effect should <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was to be overturned. These trigger laws were put into effect soon after the ruling of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, and as of today, at least a dozen states have an abortion-banning law in effect, including Texas, Florida, and Alabama.
      <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and its overturn by the Supreme Court has sparked many controversies in modern America and has become a political partisan issue, and may set a precedent for other future cases in the nation regarding same-sex marriages, contraceptives, etc. in terms of freedom of privacy.</p>
