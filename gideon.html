      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Clarence Earl Gideon was arrested and charged for breaking and entering with the intent to commit burglary and larceny in Florida after a witness testimony accused him of burglarizing a bar and pool room (he was innocent).
        Gideon did not have enough money to hire a lawyer, so he asked the state to appoint him one. However, under Florida state law, lawyers may be appointed by the state only in cases where an indigent defendant faces the death penalty, and since larceny does not institute a death penalty, Gideon was not appointed a lawyer.
        Representing himself, Gideon was tried and sentenced for 5 years. He filed a <em>habeas corpus</em> appeal(by himself after studying law in prison) to the Florida Supreme Court on grounds that the state’s decision to not appoint him a lawyer violated his constitutional rights. The Florida Supreme Court denied it, but the US Supreme Court took up the case.

    <div> <!--major question-->
      <h2>Major Question</h2>
      <p>"Does the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel in criminal cases extend to felony defendants in state courts?”</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--clauses and precedents-->
      <h2>Relevant Constitutional Clauses and Supreme Court Precedents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Due Process Clause(Fourteenth Amendment): “[...] <em>nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law</em> [...]"</li>
        <li>Right to an Attorney(Sixth Amendment): "<em>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to...have the assistance of counsel for his defense.</em>"</li>
        <li><em>Betts v. Brady</em> - Overturned by <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>, <em>Betts v. Brady</em> set a precedent that defendants cannot request a state appointed attorney unless they are indigent(illiterate, etc.). This precedent was overturned by Gideon v. Wainwright, which gave the right to counsel to all defendants in any criminal case, regardless of capital punishment or indigency.</li>
        <li><em>Powell v. Alabama</em> - A right from <em>Powell v. Alabama</em> was reaffirmed in this case in that indigent defendants had the right to an attorney in capital cases. If the defendant wants an attorney but cannot provide one for themselves, then the state must appoint one for them. This attorney must be appointed by the state far in advance of the trial and must be informed about the details of the case. In <em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em>, though, the Supreme Court took that right and applied to it all citizens in the United States, regardless of the case's circumstances or perceived punishment for the defendant.</li>

      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Majority opinion written by Hugo Black</dt>
        <dd>Taking precedence from <em>Powell v. Alabama</em> and overturning <em>Betts v. Brady</em>, the majority opinion stated that defendants in any case, state or federal, capital or otherwise, have the right to an attorney if requested as part of the Sixth Amendment, which can only be waived by the defendant in sound mind and body. Due to incorporation by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and the right to a fair trial and attorney, that part of the Amendment applies to the state trials as well.
        </dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Tom Clark</dt>
        <dd>Adding onto that, since the Sixth Amendment does not distinguish between capital or non-capital cases, all defendants should have the right to an attorney regardless if the case constituted a capital punishment or not.
        </dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by John Harlan II</dt>
        <dd>The fact that it was a criminal charge is sufficient justification to grant the defendant the right to an attorney, regardless whether if it was a state trial or if the defendant was indigent or in poverty or neither.
        </dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by William Douglas</dt>
        <dd>In agreement with the majority opinion, Justice Douglas also pushes on more elaboration and scrutiny on which rights from the Bill of Rights can be incorporated into the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, using both the Due Process Clause and the Priviliges and Immunities Clause.

    <div> <!--relevance-->
      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p>The major relevance of this case was the incorporation of the right to an attorney by the Sixth Amendment to the states.
      Before, the right to an attorney was only guaranteed in the case of federal crimes as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, while states have the power and jurisdiction over the appointing of an attorney for defendants in state crimes.
      Gideon v. Wainwright allowed the Supreme Court to take the Sixth Amendment and selectively incorporate it to the states, meaning that all defendants, regardless of the severity or nature of the crime, are entitled to an attorney by the state if they cannot provide their own and request one by the state.
      Any state law that prohibits the appointment of a defendant that violated state law in any way, shape, or form was made unconstitutional by the Gideon case.
