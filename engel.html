    <h1><em>Engel v. Vitale</em> (1962)</h1>
    <div> <!--background-->
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>New York’s State Board of Regents, an organization created by the state’s legislature to oversee the public school system, wrote and authorized a short prayer to the Christian God to open the school day for public schools. This prayer was led by a teacher or a student and was did not require a student’s participation if they wished to remain silent. Even so,
      a group of families and organizations, including two Jewish families (one of them being Steve Engel), a member of the American Ethical Union, a Unitarian, and a non-religious family; joined together to challenge the prayer in court, claiming that the daily recital violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment’s freedom of religion.
      The New York Court of Appeals heard the case and rejected the organizations’ arguments, so they appealed the case up to the Supreme Court.

    <div> <!--major question-->
      <h2>Major Question</h2>
      <p>“Does the reading of a nondenominational prayer at the start of the school day violate the "establishment of religion" clause of the First Amendment?”</p>
    </div>
    <div> <!--clauses and precedents-->
      <h2>Relevant Constitutional Clauses and Supreme Court Precedents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishment Clause(1st Amendment) - “<em>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion</em>...”</li>
        <li><em>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</em> - The Barnette case was a precedent for the Engel case, as it held many similarities in both its background and its ruling. In this case, the West Virginia State Board of Education required students to salute the flag, else they would be charged with “insubordination.” Families of students that identify as Jedovah’s Witnesses then sued the board on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause, which the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the families in that the government cannot require people to express beliefs they don’t believe in, especially when it comes to religion. It was from this precedent that the prayer in the Engel case became unconstitutional, as it pressured students not of the Christian faith to say the prayer and express a belief that they don’t believe in.
        </li>
        <li><em>McCollum v. Board of Education </em>- In the McCollum case, the Supreme Court ruled that a public school violated the Establishment Clause when the school taught religious instruction by inviting religious instructors to teach the students during school hours on school property. As government administrators (school officials) invited instructors from a certain religion to teach at a public non-religious school, this violated the Establishment Clause as it showed a governmental preference of a single religion. This belief was also used as a precedent for the Engel case in that schools cannot endorse one religion over the others.
