    <h1><em>McDonald v. City of Chicago</em> (2010)</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The City of Chicago had dictated that citizens who wished to own a handgun must register it, which practically banned most Chicago residents from owning one.
      Otis McDonald, as well as 3 other Chicago residents and gun owners from the National Rifle Association(NRA) then challenged those restrictions imposed by the city government,
      inspired by the previous Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> in which a handgun ban in the DC area was overridden by the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment.
      McDonald sought to expand the Second Amendment into the states using the Fourteenth Amendment's selective incorporation process, arguing that the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected by the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.
      While the district court and the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the case, the Supreme Court heard the appeal in 2010.

      <h3 class="ruling">Majority</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Majority opinion written by Samuel Alito</dt>
        <dd>Basing their opinions on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the majority opinion believed that the Second Amendment applied to state and local governments. Of course, there will still be the restrictions imposed on handguns by the Heller case, such as restrictions on school zones and federal property, etc.</dd>
        <dt>Concurring opinion written by Clarence Thomas</dt>
        <dd>Instead of using the Due Process clause, Justice Thomas, in concurrence, believes instead  that the Second Amendment was integrated into the Fourteenth through the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause.</dd>

      <h3 class="ruling">Dissenting</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by John Stevens</dt>
        <dd>Justice Stevens argued that owning a handgun or firearm was not a fundamental "liberty" that was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</dd>
        <dt>Dissenting opinion written by Stephen Breyer</dt>
        <dd>In the Second Amendment, there is no clause, phrase, or portion mentioning that the right to bear arms was a fundamental right that deserved protection by the Fourteenth Amendment in the states.</dd>

    <div> <!--relevance-->
      <h2>Current Relevance</h2>
      <p>After the rulings of McDonald and Heller, numerous other cases challenging the constitutionality of state laws banning guns popped up across the country, mostly spearheaded by the NRA. This is mainly because McDonald v. Chicago allows for the Supreme Court to incorporate the Second Amendment to the states, meaning any state law that restricts or bans guns is now considered unconstitutional by this ruling.
      However, this doesn’t mean that all state laws involving firearms are struck down. There is still some debate on whether some state and federal gun laws are constitutional or not, whether wholly or in part.
      But in essence, people are allowed to carry and possess firearms at varying levels of restriction depending on the state’s laws, so long as the state does not outright ban the possession of firearms. <br><br>
      This does create some problems, however. Due to the McDonald case only outlawing the banning of possession of firearms, gun control has become a lot more lax, leading to an increased number of gun-related violence and shootings within the past decades.
      Gun control has also gained relevance as a political issue, as liberal politicians call for stricter regulations and restrictions on firearms(but not outright banning them) while conservatives have called for more lax gun control laws as a way to give power to the states.
